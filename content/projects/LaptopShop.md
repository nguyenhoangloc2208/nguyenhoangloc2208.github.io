Our university internship thesis project, a collaborative effort between two team members, revolves around developing a laptop shop website. As the frontend developer, I focus on creating an intuitive user interface that enhances the browsing and shopping experience. Our goal is to deliver a seamless platform where customers can explore a diverse range of laptops, compare specifications, and make informed purchasing decisions.
