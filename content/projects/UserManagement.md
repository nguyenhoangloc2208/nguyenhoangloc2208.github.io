This user management web application is built using React and utilizes [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/). The application communicates with a backend API developed in Node.js, with data stored on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com) and media hosted on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). This setup ensures efficient data handling and storage solutions, providing a robust platform for managing users.
