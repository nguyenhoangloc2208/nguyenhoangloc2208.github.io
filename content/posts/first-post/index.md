## Welcome to my first blog post!

This post serves as an example of how new articles can be added to the website. You can find this post listed on the main "Blog" page, and it will also appear under the "gatsby", "react", "blog", and "sample" tags.

### How to create new posts:

1.  Create a new directory inside `content/posts/` (e.g., `content/posts/my-new-post/`).
2.  Inside this new directory, create an `index.md` file.
3.  Add frontmatter to the top of the `index.md` file, similar to this one. Make sure to set `draft: false` to publish the post.
4.  Write your content in Markdown below the frontmatter.

Enjoy blogging!
