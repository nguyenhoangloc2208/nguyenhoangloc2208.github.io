## Introduction to Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. They are not ready-to-use pieces of code; rather, they are templates that help you to write better, more maintainable, and reusable code.

### Types of Design Patterns

*   **Creational Patterns:** Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
    *   _Example: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype._
*   **Structural Patterns:** Deal with the composition of classes and objects.
    *   _Example: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy._
*   **Behavioral Patterns:** Deal with the communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities between them.
    *   _Example: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor._

## Understanding Design Styles

Design styles, often referred to as architectural styles or paradigms, are high-level approaches to organizing the structure and behavior of a system. They provide a common vocabulary and a set of principles for designing software.

### Common Design Styles

*   **Monolithic Architecture:** A traditional, single-tiered software application where all components are tightly coupled and run as a single process.
*   **Microservices Architecture:** An approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.
*   **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** A style that focuses on services as discrete units of functionality that can be reused and combined.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA):** A style in which decoupled services produce, consume, and react to events.
*   **Layered Architecture:** Divides the concerns of the application into horizontal layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access).

## Conclusion

Both design patterns and design styles are crucial concepts in software engineering. While patterns offer solutions at a more granular level (within a component or module), styles provide the overall structural framework for an application. Understanding and applying both can significantly improve the quality and scalability of your software projects.
